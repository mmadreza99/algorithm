# algorithm
fcfs / RR / SRTF


Implementing three algorithms:
- First come, first served (FCFS): Exit in the order of arrival is one of the methods of organizing data control according to time and prioritization.
- Round-robin scheduling: The round-robin scheduling algorithm is one of the simplest scheduling algorithms for processing in the operating system.
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF): In the shortest process selection algorithm, a process that requires the shortest processing time is selected for processing.
